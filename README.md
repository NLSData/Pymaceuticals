For this challenge, we observed the changes of the tumor development on 248 mice over a span of 45 days. Each mice was under a different drug treatment. There were ten different total drug treatments.
The purpose of this analysis was to see if the drug Capomulin, was more effective than the other drug treatments.

We had to display our data through several different forms of visualization, such as pie charts, bar graphs, line charts, box plots, and scatter plots.
After some observations, we can conclude that Capomulin was the second most effective drug after Ramicane, if we base our observation off of the mean tumor volume. 

I got help with my code from a tutoring session, as well as Xpert learning Assistant, and chatGPT.
